  abstract: Using loan-level data from Germany, we investigate how the introduction of modelbased capital regulation affected banks’ ability to absorb shocks. The objective of this regulation was to enhance financial stability by making capital requirements responsive to asset risk. Our evidence suggests that banks ‘optimized’ model-based regulation to lower their capital requirements. Banks systematically underreported risk, with underreporting being more pronounced for banks with higher gains from it. Moreover, large banks benefitted from the regulation at the expense of smaller banks. Overall, our results suggest that sophisticated rules may have undesired effects if strategic misbehavior is difficult to detect.

  title: "Talent in Distressed Firms: Investigating the Labor Costs of Financial Distress"

  abstract: The importance of skilled labor and the inalienability of human capital expose firms to the risk of losing talent at critical times. Using Swedish microdata, we document that firms lose workers with the highest cognitive and noncognitive skills as they approach bankruptcy. In a quasi-experiment, we confirm that financial distress drives these results: following a negative export shock caused by exogenous currency movements, talent abandons the firm, but only if the exporter is highly leveraged. Consistent with talent dependence being associated with higher labor costs of financial distress, firms that rely more on talent have more conservative capital structures.

  title: Leverage Buyouts and Bond Credit Spreads

  date: 2020
  abstract: Recent decades have witnessed several waves of buyout activity. We find leveraged buyouts (LBOs) to be a significant concern for bondholders by showing that a) intra-industry credit spreads increase upon an LBO announcement, b) yields on bonds without event risk covenants are, on average, 21 basis points higher than those on same-firm bonds with such covenants, and c) structural models calibrated to historical LBO events imply an impact of 18–21 basis points on 10-year credit spreads. The impact is strongest in expansion periods and for bonds with maturities of 10–20 years.
  
  title: Experience of Communal Conflicts and Inter-group Lending
  pdf: assets/papers/2020_JPE.pdf
  authors: R. Fisman, A.Sarkar and J. Skrastins
  journal: Journal of Political Economy
  date: 2020
  abstract: We provide microeconomic evidence on ethnic frictions and market efficiency, using dyadic data on managers and borrowers from a large Indian bank. We conjecture that, if exposure to religion-based communal violence intensifies intergroup animosity, riot exposure will lead to lending decisions that are more sensitive to a borrower’s religion. We find that riot-exposed Hindu branch managers lend relatively less to Muslim borrowers and that these loans are less likely to default, consistent with riot exposure exacerbating taste-based discrimination. This bias is persistent across a bank officer’s tenure, suggesting that the economic costs of ethnic conflict are long-lasting, potentially spanning across generations.

  title: How Organizational Hierarchy Affects Information Production
  pdf: assets/papers/2019_RFS.pdf
  authors: J. Skrastins
  journal: Review of Financial Studies
  date: 2019
  abstract: We exploit a variation in organizational hierarchy induced by a reorganization plan implemented in roughly 2,000 bank branches in India. We do so to investigate how organizational hierarchy affects the allocation of credit. We find that increased hierarchization of a branch induces credit rationing, reduces loan performance, and generates standardization in loan contracts. Additionally, we find that hierarchical structures perform better in environments characterized by a high degree of corruption, highlighting the benefits of hierarchies in restraining rent-seeking activities. Overall, our results are consistent with the view that valuable information may be lost in hierarchical structures.

  title: Rent Seeking in Elite Networks
  pdf: assets/papers/2018_JPE.pdf
  authors: R. Haselmann and D. Schoenherr
  journal: Journal of Political Economy 
  date: 2018
  abstract: We employ a unique data set on members of an elite service club in Germany to investigate how social connections in elite networks affect the allocation of resources. Specifically, we investigate credit allocation decisions of banks to firms inside the network. Using a quasi-experimental research design, we document misallocation of bank credit inside the network, with bankers with weakly aligned incentives engaging most actively in crony lending. Our findings, thus, resonate with existing theories of elite networks as rent extractive coalitions that stifle economic prosperity.

  title: Cultural Proximity and Loan Outcomes
  pdf: assets/papers/2017_AER.pdf
  authors: R. Fisman and D. Paravisini
  journal: American Economic Review
  date: 2017
  abstract: We present evidence that cultural proximity (shared codes, beliefs, ethnicity) between lenders and borrowers increases the quantity of credit and reduces default. We identify in-group lending using dyadic data on religion and caste for officers and borrowers from an Indian bank, and a rotation policy that induces exogenous matching between them. Having an in-group officer increases credit access and loan size dispersion, reduces collateral requirements, and induces better repayment even after the in-group officer leaves. We consider a range of explanations and suggest that the findings are most easily explained by cultural proximity serving to mitigate information frictions in lending.

  title: Labor Protection and Leverage
  pdf: assets/papers/2015_RFS.pdf
  authors: E. Simintzi and P. Volpin
  journal: Review of Financial Studies 
  date: 2015
  abstract: This paper exploits intertemporal variations in employment protection across countries and finds that rigidities in labor markets are an important determinant of firms' capital structure decisions. Over the 1985–2007 period, we find that reforms increasing employment protection are associated with a 187 basis point reduction in leverage. We interpret this finding to suggest that employment protection increases operating leverage, crowding out financial leverage. This result does not appear to be due to pretreatment differences between treated and control firms, omitted variables, unobserved changes in regional economic conditions, and reverse causality. Heterogeneous treatment effects are consistent with our economic intuition.

  title: "The Failure of Models that Predict Failure: Distance, Incentives, and Defaults"
  pdf: assets/papers/2015_JFE.pdf
  authors: U. Rajan and A. Seru
  journal: Journal of Financial Economics
  date: 2015
  abstract: Statistical default models, widely used to assess default risk, fail to account for a change in the relations between different variables resulting from an underlying change in agent behavior. We demonstrate this phenomenon using data on securitized subprime mortgages issued in the period 1997–2006. As the level of securitization increases, lenders have an incentive to originate loans that rate high based on characteristics that are reported to investors, even if other unreported variables imply a lower borrower quality. Consistent with this behavior, we find that over time lenders set interest rates only on the basis of variables that are reported to investors, ignoring other credit-relevant information. As a result, among borrowers with similar reported characteristics, over time the set that receives loans becomes worse along the unreported information dimension. This change in lender behavior alters the data generating process by transforming the mapping from observables to loan defaults. To illustrate this effect, we show that the interest rate on a loan becomes a worse predictor of default as securitization increases. Moreover, a statistical default model estimated in a low securitization period breaks down in a high securitization period in a systematic manner: it underpredicts defaults among borrowers for whom soft information is more valuable. Regulations that rely on such models to assess default risk could, therefore, be undermined by the actions of market participants.

  title: The Private Returns to Public Office

  authors: F. Schulz and R. Fisman
  journal: Journal of Political Economy
  date: 2014
  abstract: We study the wealth accumulation of Indian state politicians using public disclosures required of all candidates. The annual asset growth of winners is 3–5 percent higher than that of runners-up, a difference that holds also in a set of close elections. The relative asset growth of winners is greater in more corrupt states and for those holding ministerial positions. These results are consistent with a rent-seeking explanation for the relatively high rate of growth in winners’ assets.

  pages: 247-297
  abstract: "Entering a currency union without any political union European countries
    have taken a gamble: will the needs of the currency unions force a political integration
    (as anticipated by Monnet) or will the tensions create a backlash, as suggested
    by Kaldor, Friedman and many others? We try to answer this question by analyzing
    the cross sectional and time series variation in pro-European sentiments in the
    EU 15 countries. The 1992 Maastricht Treaty seems to have reduced the pro-Europe
    sentiment as does the 2010 Eurozone crisis. Yet, in spite of the worst recession
    in recent history, the Europeans still support the common currency. Europe seems
    trapped: there is no desire to go backward, no interest in going forward, but
    it is economically unsustainable to stay still."

  abstract: While both cultural and legal norms (institutions) help foster cooperation,
    culture is the more primitive of the two and itself sustains formal institutions.
    Cultural changes are rarer and slower than changes in legal institutions, which
    makes it difficult to identify the role played by culture. Cultural changes and
    their effects are easier to identify in simpler, more controlled, environments,
    such as corporations. Corporate culture, thus, is not only interesting per se,
    but also as a laboratory to study the role of societal culture and the way it
    can be changed.

  pages: 60-76
  abstract: We study which dimensions of corporate culture are related to a firm'
    performance and why. We find that proclaimed values appear irrelevant. Yet, when
    employees perceive top managers as trustworthy and ethical, firm' performance
    is stronger. We then study how different governance structures impact the ability
    to sustain integrity as a corporate value. We find that publicly traded firms
    are less able to sustain it. Traditional measures of corporate governance do not
    seem to have much of an impact.

  journal: Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics

  pages: 63-76
  abstract: "We use a combination of lab and field evidence to study whether highly-impatient
    individuals are more likely to procrastinate. To measure impatience, we elicit
    individual discount rates by giving participants choices between smaller-sooner
    and larger-later rewards. To measure procrastination, we record how fast participants
    complete three tasks: an online game, their application to the university, and
    a mandatory survey. We find that, consistent with the theory, impatient individuals
    procrastinate more, but only in tasks where there are costs to delay (the online
    game and university application). Since we paid participants by check to control
    for transaction costs, we are also able to determine whether the participants'
    cashing behavior is consistent with the timing of their payment choice. We find
    substantial evidence of time inconsistency. Namely, more than half of the participants
    who received their check straight away instead of waiting two weeks for a reasonably
    larger amount, subsequently took more than two weeks to cash it."
